Soon, I will begin a new series on `Leadership & Management (L&M)`. This series aims to introduce some real-life scenarios which you may face in your professional life. Probably you have already faced them.
<!--more-->

Scenarios like:
- Love relationship between CEO and a member of the management team;
- There are still companies that rely on an Excel sheet for all its data analysis, like financial, sales, human resources;
- When do you start to feel that your CEO might not be right for the job;
- Be alert to toxic workplace culture signs.  

These were just a few topics that we will address during this series. I hope you will find it interesting to follow along.

See you soon!
