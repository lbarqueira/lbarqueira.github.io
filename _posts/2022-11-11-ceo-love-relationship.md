I would say things will go wrong, especially for the company. Let`s dive deeper...

Love relationships at work always exist. Just realize that the vast majority of our time is spent at work to come to the conclusion that workspaces are ideal places to initialize a romance.

If both persons are on the same hierarchical organization level, and therefore one does not control the other's career progression (directly or indirectly), there is less potential for conflict or feelings of unfair treatment with other employees.

However, even in this situation, the way the two involved employees deal with their personal relationship within the work environment may or may not lead to a toxic work environment. Hence, it is important for the manager or human resources to make sure professional lines aren’t being crossed.

The big issue arises when both persons are on a different hierarchical organization level, i.e, in cases of a manager dating a subordinate. This scenario will make others at the company suspect that favoritism is at play. And that will undermines the idea of meritocracy and the idea that everyone has a fair shot.

This leads us to the worst possible scenario, which is when a __CEO has an Employee Relationship.__

A CEO should ask himself: what example do I pass to employees and clients when having a relationship with an employee? 

A CEO should lead by example, increasing trust and respect from their employees. A good example will inspire others to follow. A CEO know their words and actions are up for interpretation.  

The behavior of leaders has an outsized effect on organizational performance. This is placed in sharp relief by the growing understanding that people don’t generally leave jobs — they leave bosses.
