In 2022, I created a [website](https://tourmaline-klepon-15f45d.netlify.app/) (written in ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹Portuguese) whose purpose is to present an elementary introduction to management, more specifically, on the following topics:
- Financial Information;
- Financial Calculus;
- Investment Projects.

The information documented [here](https://tourmaline-klepon-15f45d.netlify.app/) is based on the syllabus of several introductory management courses held at Portuguese universities, namely at [Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/) - the largest school of Architecture, Engineering, Science and Technology in Portugal, involving a community of over 10,000 people.

The theoretical information is synthetic and practical, complemented by practical exercises that illustrate its application.

The reference book for the theoretical synthesis is essentially [GestÃ£o â€“ Conceitos e ExercÃ­cios PrÃ¡ticos, by JoÃ£o Oliveira Soares](https://www.wook.pt/livro/gestao-conceitos-e-exercicios-praticos-joao-oliveira-soares/27394180). This is an excellent book that this site in no way replaces. Hence I strongly recommend that you purchase it, at the above link.
