My name is Luis Barqueira. I have more than 20 years of professional experience in Sales at companies, like Dell EMC and Siemens. At least 10 years in the management and leadership of sales teams.

Currently, I have been fulfilling a dream, which is software development. Having a MSc in Electrical and Computer Engineering, I have always been passionate about software development.

The main purpose of this blog is:

- with regard to `Leadership and Management`, to share some practical scenarios that I faced during my professional experience, in order to analyze them;

- regarding `Software Development`, to share my learning path, and the projects that I have been making.

I would like to have your feedback along this journey, so feel free to DM me on Twitter with your opinions, questions and comments.

See you soon!
