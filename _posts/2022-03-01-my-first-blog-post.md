My name is Luis Barqueira. I have more than 20 years of professional experience in Sales at companies, like Dell EMC and Siemens. At least 10 years in the management and leadership of sales teams.

For various reasons, I ended up not developing my professional career where I would actually be more interested, more specifically in Software Development and Data Visualization. Fortunately, since 2019, I have been achieving this goal of mine. Having a MSc in Electrical and Computer Engineering, I have always been passionate about software development.

The main purpose of this blog is to share my own experience on those two fields, `Leadership & Management` and `Software Development`:

- with regard to `Leadership & Management`, to share some practical scenarios that I faced during my professional experience, in order to analyze them;

- regarding `Software Development`, to share my learning path, and the projects that I have been doing. Namely projects related to data visualization.

I would like to have your feedback along this journey, so feel free to DM me on Twitter with your opinions, questions and comments.

See you soon!
