### Turn website into PWA
Working without [Workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox) ... In this approach I have specifically to say what are the routes that I want to cache for offline support.

[Como transformar um site no github pages feito com jekyll em uma pwa](https://regino.dev/como-transformar-um-site-no-github-pages-feito-com-jekyll-em-uma-pwa/)

[Adding a service worker to Jekyll](https://tosbourn.com/adding-service-worker-to-jekyll/)

- to analyze: F12 to open Dev Tools, the service-worker.js does not change after I have changed it in githuh??

Manually managing the cache storage via your Service Worker script can be a tedious task. The number of files and their names may change, so hard-coding them does not seem like a good idea. Thatâ€™s where Workbox comes in.

TODO: Another tutorial, but using [Workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox)

Note: For now if you Lighthouse audit the site, PWA is checked.

### Change to a regular theme instead of a Gem-based theme

With this change I now have all the freedom to make changes to my blog.
