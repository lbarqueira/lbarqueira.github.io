This site is all about my own experience in two main topics. 

- __Leadership & Management (`L&M`);__
- __Software Development (`SD`).__

Through real practical examples, I will try to analyze them based on both, my professional experience (`L&M`) and my experience as a student (`SD`).

You can check my [first blog][Great to meet you!] where I present myself to you.

Regarding __Software Development__, I will focus mainly on Android Native with Kotlin, besides some incursions on C, Prolog, and Python. 

All source code presented in this blog you can find it at my GitHub account:

I promise I will try to make this blog fun, especially concerning L&M, where most of the literature is boring.
