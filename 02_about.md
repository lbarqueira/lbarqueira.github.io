This site is all about my own experience in two main fields. 

- __Leadership & Management (`L&M`);__
- __Software Development (`SW`).__

Through real practical examples, I will try to analyze them based on both, my professional experience (`L&M`) and my experience as an enthusiast (`SW`).

You can check my [first blog][Great to meet you!] where I present myself to you, and I explain the reasons for these two topics.

[Great to meet you!]: https://lbarqueira.github.io/2022/03/01/my-first-blog-post.html

Regarding __Software Development__, I will focus mainly on Data Visualization projects, using __R__ and __Python__ programming languages.
